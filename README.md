# Responsice Music Website Design

Created a modern Responsive Music Website design while learning figma created this completely responsive Music App Design with awesome color theme. I have used CSS Flexbox,
Media queries for responsive design and CSS transition for some cool animation effects. Also I have added a Sidebar for it. This project contains Sidebar,
Music Player, Header, Genres and Top Musics sections.
